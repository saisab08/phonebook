#AND OPERATION:- ALL the command given by the user must be right to get the true output.EG:
a = 10
b=20
print(a==10 and b>a)

#OR Operation:- At least one of the command given by the user should be true to get the true output.EG:
a = 100
b= 50
print(a<=b or b!=a )
print(a==50 and a<50 or b!=a)

#NOT OPERATION :- It will reverse the output like if the user get True in output it will reverses to false and viceversa.EG:
a = 10
b = 20
print(a<b)
#using not operation
print(not a<b)
